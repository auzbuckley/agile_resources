`Delivering value quickly through empirical, iterative product development.`

## **Agile Manifesto Values**

1. **People and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
3. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

## **Four pillars of agility**

Another approach to briefly explaining more tangible areas in which agility involves itself, inspired byÂ [modern agile](http://modernagile.org/), are these four pillars.

- Engagement
- Transparency and collaboration
- Continuous Delivery of Value
- Rapid experimentation
