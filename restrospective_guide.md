# A guide to retrospectives

Retros are possibly the most important/ valuable event to take place in an agile work environment. They provide us with a time to reflect; to inspect and adapt. In other words, they facilitate continuous improvement in the way we work - but only when done properly.

## Who should run a retrospective?
In theory anyone can run a retrospective with a bit of practice. However even for someone experienced, it can be difficult to both run and participate in your own team's retrospective. It might be worth recruiting volunteer 'Retro Runners' to help facilitate retros for teams other than their own. This also helps with the 'cross-pollinating' of ideas and solutions between teams.

## The Retrospective
This guide will outline the main phases of a generic retrospective; meaning this is not the only way retrospectives can be run, but could be considered a good basis.

Recommended length: About 1hr - 1 1/2hrs

### Pre-retro
* Collect the teams previous action points (if they had any) and have them ready so you can refer to them during the retrospective.
* Decide on your retro format and/ or theme. For general but pretty solid and reliable themes it would be recommended to choose 'Start, Stop, Continue', 'I Like, I wish', or even 'Lean Coffee'. Come see the Agile coach to learn more.
* Ensure you have the right equipment (sticky notes, pens, flipchart, whiteboard)
* Make sure you have a watch or device to keep track of time. You will need it.
* Bring a notepad or laptop for taking notes.

### Phase 1: The warm-up (optional)
:stopwatch: 15mins

The idea of the warm-up is to get every one's brain juices flowing about the last few weeks. This can be an optimal time to get a 'feel-good' factor going by playing for example, 'The Appreciation Game'. Or to gauge everyone's expectations of what they want to get out of the retrospective. Or simply to sum up the last few weeks in three words to get them thinking for what follows.

One 'game' that can be interesting to play if you want to gauge how in tune the team is with one another is ['Empathy Snap'](http://www.funretrospectives.com/empathy-snap-on-big-hitter-moments/).

### Phase 2: Check status of previous action points
:stopwatch: 5mins

This is a crucial part of the retrospective. Having collected the team's previous action items before the retrospective, you will run through them to check with the team which have been completed and which are still in progress. For those still in progress, ask if they are still relevant and worthy to be carried over into the next sprint. Keep the amount of these 'carried over' action points in mind when generating new action points in Phase 6.

### Data Gathering
:stopwatch: 5mins

Data gathering is essentially the 'meat-and-bones' of the retrospective.

Having chosen your retro format and drawn it on the board, briefly explain it if the team is unfamiliar with it.

Give each person a set of sticky notes and a pen. You might need to watch the clock carefully on this phase. Some teams may seem to endlessly generate new topics and it is advised to let them know progressively how much time they have left.

Feel free to end the timebox early though if you notice everyone has finished writing.

### Show & Tell
:stopwatch: 15mins

Once Phase 3 time is up, have each member stand and stick their notes to the white board accordingly and briefly explain each one. Again keep track of the time, and although others can ask questions to clarify, don't let conversation get too carried away. If it is an important issue, the team will have a chance in the next phase to vote on it to discuss further. Also ensure the speaker doesn't waffle e.g. reiterate their point multiple times or digress from the topic at hand.

It is advised to write down each topic being presented to record the team's thoughts.

### Grouping & Voting
:stopwatch: 5mins

Usually team members will have raised similar or even identical topics. Now is the time to group them via affinity mapping. Encourage everyone to stand up and do this interactively. For the sake of clarity, have them write the group topic beside the grouped notes. Ensure they know that not all notes need to be grouped if it doesn't make sense. Don't let them take too long.

If your theme has a positive aspect, it might not make sense to group positive and negative notes together. This is because usually (but not always) if a team is doing something well, they will not have much to say by way of generating action points (in the next phase).

Once you have clearly grouped topics give everyone three 'dot' votes. Explain that they are voting for the topics they wish to discuss in greater depth and to generate action points to improve. They can leave all three dots on one group or note, or spread them between groups. (Again keep an eye on people voting on positive topics - and ensure they understand the next phase is about deciding how to improve upon these topics.)

### Generating Action Points
:stopwatch: 30mins

This phase is absolutely crucial in order for the retrospective to have concrete worth. If all anyone did in retrospective was raise concerns and no action was decided, it would quickly become perceived as a waste of time and just an opportunity for the team to complain (creating an unpleasant environment).

Take the group or note with the most votes and begin questioning the team on how they can improve in this area. Remember it is not your job to come up with the action points, you as the facilitator must be able to egg out of the team solutions to their own problems. This is hard.

One of the best ways to get to the root cause is to use the '5 why's' technique. Simply ask why the topic is in its current unsatisfactory state and you will likely get an answer. Ask why the answer is the way it is and so on and so forth until it becomes clear what the real problem is.

When coming up with action points make sure they have the following qualities:

* Are assigned to someone (even if the action point might refer to the entire team - someone needs to take responsibility for ensuring the entire team takes action)
* Are actually achievable (improve code quality for example has no real 'end' - continue to dig deeper and come up with a completable task that will contribute to improving code quality)
* Are time-boxed to the next two weeks (Action points should not be so large they drag on into infinity)

Try to keep action points evenly spread between team members (don't let them all pile on the team lead for example) and ensure there are no more than 3-4. However it can be less or more depending on the relative size of the action points. The idea here is to ensure the team is not overwhelmed with improvement items and setting them up to fail before they even begin. This is also when you need to consider the number of 'carry over' action points from the last iteration.

Write down the action points and the assignee as they become known. It can also be helpful to link the action point with the problem it is intended to improve for better clarity.

Once you are done generating action points, reiterate them to the team including who is assigned to each.

### Retro Closing (Optional - but recommended)
:stopwatch: 5mins

In the spirit of continuous improvement, it can be best (if time allows it) to get feedback on the retrospective itself. This enables you to stay in tune with the team and provide them with maximum value.

Sometimes pinning a 'Happy', 'Neutral', and 'Sad' sticky next to the door for team members to leave a vote on how they felt the retro went can be enough.

Other times, if you want more concrete feedback, you can give them a few minutes to write down one thing they liked about the retro and one thing they would improve.

### Post-retro
When the retro is over it is advised to send the team a summary (containing the notes you collected throughout the retrospective, specifically, the topics they generated and the action points they devised.)

It is also recommended to remind the team to make these action points highly visible, somewhere they can see and be reminded of frequently. Many of the tech teams have the action points displayed on their Scrum boards around which they perform their daily standups.

## Summary
As you can see, running a retrospective well is not an easy task. Although this guide is intended to give you something to cut your teeth on, and to prove you with some reference without having to track down the Agile Coach or scour google, it is exactly that, a guide. If you do have any concerns or questions, or wish to use more elaborate retrospective formats or techniques, it is advised to speak with the Agile Coach for support.

## Retro Tips

:white_check_mark: Retro's are nearly useless without good action items, no matter how well you run the rest of the retrospective.

:white_check_mark: Be careful with 'gamification' - sometimes this can come across to teams as being treated like children, impractical, foolish and a waste of time. Ensuring the retro is not tedious, but not turning it into the adult equivalent of finger painting and colouring-in requires balance and knowing the team.

:white_check_mark: Ensure to capture _positive_ topics. Retro's that focus only on the negative can damage morale over a period of time.

:white_check_mark: It can be useful to mention that improvement topics that cannot be directly addressed or resolved by the team be noted and escalated but not dwelt on. Frustration can arise quickly if the team discusses a problem deemed to be caused by an external situation or party.

:white_check_mark: If the retro is less than 1 1/2hrs, you'll have to decide whether to cut non-crucial phases such as the warm-up or closing, and be diligent in tracking the time.

:white_check_mark: For small, 'informal' or ad-hoc retrospectives, [lean coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) is a pretty light-weight and dependable approach.
