# Why it is important to keep your product backlog _lean_

## Cost of Delay
_**The longer your backlog the longer it will take to deliver anything on it.**_
Being first to market is important. The longer you make your customer wait, the higher the chance they will go to a competitor, or your competitor will deliver the same idea before you.

Why is this the case? Because the bigger your backlog, the more 'noise' there is and the more time is needed to sort through it and maintain it (CRUD: creating, reading (searching), updating, deleting.)

## Loss of Focus
The more items you have on your backlog the less likely you are focusing on what needs to be done now and investing time in longer term items which have inherent uncertainty.

## Inventory represents cost (that you may never recoup)
The more items you have on your backlog the more WIP or inventory you have i.e. work that has been started but not finished. This is work that represents time (and therefore money) already spent but does not yet have any return on investment and may never (if it devalues over time).

## Markets and organizations are not static
Items can devalue over time leaving you with items whose only purpose has become to make backlog maintenance harder (and cost us more time).
* Context and knowledge can be lost over time as the organization changes (no one remembers why the ticket is in the backlog, or how to find a bug reported a year ago) leading to time spent on rework - or throwing it out (no ROI)
* Market demand can shift so that you can miss the window of opportunity during which a PBI will be able to have ROI

Regardless of the kinds of items on your backlog itâ€™s important to get them off and finished as soon as possible.
And as the saying goes: _**Stop starting and start finishing.**_
