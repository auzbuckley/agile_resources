# Agile Assessment Survey
A tool for getting a 'finger-in-the-air' overview to identify possible issues.
Scale 1-5. (Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree)
Questions should be answered within the context of the entire tech and product departments.

What makes this different to other seurveys such as Peakon?
This survey is specifically from an agility perspective. It helps identify potential improvement areas in how we operate that we can then further explore and hopefully address. Essentially this survey could affect our strategy for agility.


## Engagement :zap:(P5)
1. I feel that our environment provides the basic support and processes necessary to do my job without much frustration (working conditions, equipment, development processes, access requests, on-boarding, tooling, career progression, adequate performance reviews and 1-1s etc.)
2. I feel secure in my role (safety to disagree, to raise issues, my contract and notice period are fair, company is stable etc.)
3. I feel that our environment is respectful. (Do you feel it recognises, empowers, supports, provides clear expectations to, considers and trusts its employees?)
4. I feel the work I do makes a difference to our customers
5. I have the opportunity to grow professionally
6. I have reasonable autonomy over the work I do in my team
7. I feel engaged in the work that I do

## Transparency & Collaboration
1. I feel that, within product development, there are no significant knowledge-silos (either in people or teams)
2. I feel that decisions made within product development consider feedback and are well communicated (strategy, internal changes etc.)
3. I feel all teams are aligned on strategy and prioritization
4. I feel that there is *early* and regular collaboration and feedback between product development teams and stakeholders/ customersÂ :zap:**(P4)**
5. I feel that I have a say in the direction of product development
6. I feel that we are frequently reflecting on the organizational progress and/ or health of the teams, department, and productÂ :zap:**(P12)**
7. I feel I know what my team members and other teams are working on

## Valuable continuous delivery :zap:(P1)
1. I feel we are building the right things
2. I feel we effectively employ best practices in our everyday work (technical excellence, product excellence)
3. I feel that the quality of our product is high
4. I feel that we are able to respond quickly enough to changing requirementsÂ :zap:**(P2)**
5. I feel we are innovative
6. I feel we are delivering to the customer at a sustainable but frequent (<4weeks) paceÂ :zap:**(P8), (P3)**
7. I feel we are building things in the right way

## Rapid experimenting and learning (continuous improvement)
1. I feel that decisions can be made by those closest to the problem
2. I feel our environment is empirical (Do we regularly stop to learn from and make decisions based on validated observations and data rather than pure theory or assumptions?)Â :zap:**(P12)**
3. I feel our technical setup can support rapid development, deploymentÂ *and*Â recovery :zap:**(P9)**
4. I feel our environment attitude is â€˜fail-friendlyâ€™
5. I feel our teams have few dependenciesÂ (on people/ teams, processes, tools or technology) and therefore have as close to end-to-end autonomy as possible :zap:**(P11)**
6. I feel that we generally keep solutions simpleÂ :zap:**(P10)**
7. I feel that developers, designers, product, business analysts, QA etc. regularly step out of their area of expertise to provide input, challenge one another and do whatever is necessary to work as a team and get things done.
