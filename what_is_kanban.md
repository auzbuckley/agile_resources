# What is Kanban?

Kanban (translating to 'billboard' from Japanese) is a lightweight process tool orginating from [lean manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing). Having only a couple of 'rules', it is far more adaptive than it is prescriptive:

1. You must visualise your workflow for transparency
   - Work Items represented as cards
   - Named columns to indicate state (To Do, Doing, Done)
2. Limit your work in progress (WIP) for faster output, clearer focus, better planning, more transparency, and to foster teamwork
3. Measure your cycle (and/ or lead) time for continuously improving your flow

As you can see, Kanban does not define events, roles, cross-functional teams or anything else. As a result you are free to 'fill in the gaps' where you see fit with your own solutions. Kanban is a pull-based system, but unlike Scrum which limits work in progress via time-boxed iterations (sprints), Kanban operates under continuous flow, limiting work in progress instead via restrictions on items in a particular workflow state. 

Kanban also provides a certain degree of planning flexibility.

:warning: **Beware:**

- 'Planning flexibility' should not mean being able to interrupt the team and change focus/ direction whenever it suits. However if unpredictability is simply the nature of your work, and not a consequence of poor planning and organization, for example if your team is a maintenance team that does not really work on projects per say, but instead handles issues as they arrive, then Kanban will allow you freedom to navigate this.

- If you are not diligent, using a process tool that provides a high degree of freedom can easily lead to chaos.

>"the value of a tool is that it limits your options. A process tool that lets you do anything is not very useful."
