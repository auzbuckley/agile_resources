[WORK IN PROGRESS]

# Intro
This agenda is for situations when time is scarce. Normally a design sprint should happen over the course of several days, however this pseudo-design sprint is for around 2hrs. Inspiration drawn from the following:

- https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-run-a-successful-design-sprint-1702e0f79797
- https://medium.com/@ascent0/the-2-hour-ideation-workshop-ed471c538adc

**Timebox:** 2hrs\
**Number of people:** 6-10\
**What you'll need:**
- Sticky notes
- Sharpies
- A dozen sheets of A3
- A dozen sheets of A4

## Present Problem

⏱️ 5-10mins

Ideally write the problem in a problem statement format on the board/ wall.

_[Desired Goal][The reality][Consequences]_

Briefly elaborate and answer any immediate questions fielded by the team.

:bulb: If you have time, now is a good place to inject lightning talks from SMEs such as user research, analytics etc.

:warning: _The problem is possibly the most critical part of a design sprint. Ensure that the problem has been well investigated/ researched and ideally validated (as much as possible) before bringing to a design sprint. Otherwise the agenda will quickly unravel as the team picks apart the problem with inevitable questions._

## (Optional) How Might We's

⏱️ 5mins

**What are HWMs?**\
These are opportunities - not solutions. Take possible problems or pain points and rephrase them as positive questions.

**Instructions:**\
As a warm up exercise, ask each team member to write down as many HMWs as they can (one per sticky). The purpose to is to start to get them to think about the problem at hand.

## Crazy8s
⏱️ 20mins

**What is crazy8s?**\
You have 8mins to _sketch_ as many ideas as you can on an A3 folded into 8 sections. You don't have to fill in all eight, but do your best. Don't spend time refining ideas. You don't need to have drawing skills, but if you feel too uncomfortable you can use words.

**Instructions:**
- Explain crazy8s (including how to fold the paper)
- Run the first round and count down minutes to let everyone know how much time they have left.
- Have people pair and explain their best one or two ideas in 1-2mins to cross-pollinate ideas.
- Do a second round (on the back of the A3). Reassure everyone that although a second round will be harder, the purpose is quantity over quality.

## Solution Sketching

⏱️ 30mins

Each person is to take their best idea (ensure that it addresses the initial problem) and 'solution' it.

## Presenting & Voting
Each person sticks their solution sketch to the board/ wall and quickly explains their concept and _*how it addresses the initial problem.*_
After presenation rounds, everyone gets 3 or 4 votes.

## Prioritizing
