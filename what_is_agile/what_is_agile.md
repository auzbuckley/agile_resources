# What is Agility?

Many will say to be agile is a _mindset_, which is true, but at its core is the process of empiricism. A method used for several hundred years by scientists when dealing with complex systems.
With this, agility could be said to be:

`Delivering value quickly through empirical, iterative work.`

Of course, however, there is much else needed to make this happen in a modern-day organization. Agility therefore tends to incorporate all aspects that facilitate rapid empiricism, from the motivation of people and autonomy of teams, to the transparency of information.

## **Agile Manifesto Values**

Written in 2001, the agile manifesto has become the heart of what is now simply known as Agile (capital A) and makes explicit what is valued more in a agile software development workplace.

1. **People and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
3. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

## **Four pillars of agility**

Another approach to briefly explaining more tangible areas in which agility involves itself, inspired byÂ [modern agile](http://modernagile.org/), are these four pillars.

- Engagement
- Transparency and collaboration
- Continuous Delivery of Value
- Rapid experimentation
