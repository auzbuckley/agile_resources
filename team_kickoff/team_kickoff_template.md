# Team Kick-off Agenda

## Intro
A team kick-off helps a new team through the forming phase, and an existing team through the norming phase. The purpose is to build or strengthen the foundations on which the team will grow and set them in good stead. It's important that significant time is allocated to recognize its value, and organizing it as an offsite helps to solidify this.

## Ice Breaker
:stopwatch: 30mins

Choose an icebreaker than creates some laughs but is also informative in the vein of ‘get-to-know’ for a new team or ‘how-well-do-you-know’ for existing teams.

## Working agreement
:stopwatch: 1hr

A working agreement is a social contract that outlines norms for how members should interact with one another to be successful. Topics could include how decisions will be made, how to communicate, share information or support one another. It is a living document that can be expanded or edited, should be somewhere visible and be regularly referred to in order to hold one another accountable. Ultimately it helps to develop a team culture.

1. Brainstorm around the question `“What are the risks posed from within the team that could cause you to fail as a team?”` Lack of respect, communication, collaboration etc.
2. Dot voting to identify the top 5-7 risks
3. Brainstorm what positive behaviors/ actions the team can take in order to prevent these risks
4. Dot voting to identify top 5-7 behaviors

:warning: Warning:

_Remind the team that this working agreement should be somewhere highly visible to the team (preferably not hidden away in confluence)._

## Definition of Done
:stopwatch: 1hr

The team should formulate an agreement on when PBIs are considered ‘done’. This saves time in the future from team members prematurely considering a PBI complete.
Keep this as a short and ideally measurable checklist.
The team can decide if they would like separate DoDs for different stages of development or for different types of work e.g. technical tasks vs stories or if they want to focus only on DoD activities that are mandatory for every PBI no matter the kind.
Prompt team about activites often not thought of such as release email, metrics check, or user docs updated.

1. Brainstorm all of the high-level activities that they normally do to complete a story. (Activities that they do currently, not that they _would_ do.)
2. Affinity mapping
3. Place groups in timeline
4. Create 'headline' for the activities
5. (Optional) Redefine activities involved in accomplishing the headline

Remind the team that this Definition of Done should be somewhere highly visible to the team (preferably not hidden away in confluence).
The team should reflect periodically on the DoD.
